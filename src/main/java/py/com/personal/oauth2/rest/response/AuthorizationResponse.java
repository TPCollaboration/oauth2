/** 
	4.1.1. Authorization Request


	   The client constructs the request URI by adding the following
	   parameters to the query component of the authorization endpoint URI
	   using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format, per Appendix B:

	   response_type
	         REQUIRED.  Value MUST be set to "code".
	   client_id
	         REQUIRED.  The client identifier as described in Section 2.2.
	   redirect_uri
	         OPTIONAL.  As described in Section 3.1.2.
	   scope
	         OPTIONAL.  The scope of the access request as described by
	         Section 3.3.
	   state
	         RECOMMENDED.  An opaque value used by the client to maintain
	         state between the request and callback.  The authorization
	         server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back
	         to the client.  The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing
	         cross-site request forgery as described in Section 10.12.
